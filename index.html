            <p>Since the start of it all, Little Minds made it their mission to revolutionise the space of early education by bringing a wave of change for young learners, wielding the quiet command of their tender pedagogy and affection-centric approach. Making the first years of a sprout's magic count, the school takes form of a second home, where unwavering guidance joins hands with holistic development, creating a haven for tiny wonders. Their vision shared the sentiment of the credence of Dr. Maria Montessori, the namesake of one of the cornerstones in LM town, as she phrased what would become a living, breathing torch for the institution- <em>"the child is both a hope and promise for mankind."</em></p>

                    <p>A seed sown in the silent steps of time soon blossomed into what would become one of the most cherished florets of Dehradun, taking shape of what the city knows to be Little Minds.</p>
                    
                    <p>The first stone of this institution was laid by Meenu ma'am and Saurabh sir way back in 2012 who found, in their own two daughters, the push to not do a job but realise their passion as they transitioned from corporate professionals to academic lighthouses. It has been more than a decade's worth of a journey for them and having nurtured more than 2000 souls in that time, they hold firm in their future to reach for the stars while latching on to tiny hands along the way, of course.</p>
                    
                    <p>Having seen its fair share of the ups and downs that make up life, the walls of this beloved school now glow with the laughs of each friendship that forged here, shine with the shriek of every clapping hand as song and dance comes to life and boast of the love they take away from each hatchling that flies off as a falcon.</p>
                    
                    <p>For no matter what, with Meenu ma'am and Saurabh sir breathing life into what they created with their love from the ground up, each child could always count on Little Minds to be <em>'such stuff as dreams are made of'!</em></p>

                <p>Meenu ma'am- the lucky charm that reflects on everything Little Minds puts its mind to and the adored principal of LM town. Being an MBA graduate from London, she had little an idea of how things would take a turn for her once she stepped into the world of academia and her venture forth into Doon would reap harvests sown by fate. She is the face of Little Minds and can easily be attributed to being a core reason for its success. Catch an LMite or two on event days and they will wholeheartedly attest to their favourite Meenu ma'am being a secret fairy, a claim none can dismiss.</p>

                <p>The evergreen director of Little Minds, Saurabh sir found his way into his true calling of life after being a corporate professional for more than 15 years. Having experienced all that his life in Delhi and Europe had to offer, he made his path down to the quaint town of Dehradun where then, the birth of Little Minds turned the wheels in his head. He became the brains behind one of the finest schools Doon has to offer and can often be found in his office, trying to convince the school CHOs to sort his papers instead of making balls out of them, to no avail.</p>

As she rose up the ranks, she became the force behind some of the most conversed projects of Little Minds such as Dehradun's first ever Mother Toddler Programme. A muse for Meenu ma'am and Saurabh sir as they started their educational journey, she stands by them, more as a partner than a daughter, and can be seen collecting flowers by the gate from students who can never forget the first teacher who made them say "hello ma'am" during attendance roll calls.</p>

The inspiration behind the school, she balances all aspects of the media world, curating the perfect (and imperfect) moments of what the world sees in a picture and capturing every little star that shines.
